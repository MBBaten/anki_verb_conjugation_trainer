Task: Create input data for Anki flashcards. Prioritize information regarding concepts that are good for a beginner language learner to learn. Ensure that each flashcard is clearly written, and adheres to the specified formatting and reference criteria.

Formatting Criteria: 
- Construct a table with three columns: "Front", “Back”, "Translation", "Tag", "Number".
- Each row of the "Front" column should contain a single sentence in english, there may be several verbs.
-"Translation" should contain the Brazilian Portuguese translation of the sentence. 
- The “Back” column should contain ALL the conjugated verbs from the Brazilian Portuguese translation of the sentence. Use the exact verbs from the translated sentence!
-"Tag" should contain the tense used for the verbs.
- The "Number" column will serve to number each row, facilitating feedback. 

Rules:
-Avoid Nós conjugations, use a gente instead
-Exclude tu and vós 
-Use the following tenses for possible conjugations of verbs: present perfect, preterite, imperfect past, conditional, present subjuntive, past subjuntive.
-Surround the verbs used in the sentences with <b> </b> such that the verb is bold. If there are successive verbs they should be between the brackets together: estava estudando becomes,  <b>estava estudando </b>. 
-Only verbs in the "Front" and "Translation" entries should be bold.
